*CompLexico* /k…ômÀàplekÀås…™k…í/ is a research group within the *Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on the Humanities and Social Sciences* ([CIRHSS](https://www.cirhss.org/)) at the Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University, and is formalised on 16 April 2024 by the Rector of Udayana University (Decree no. 594/UN14/HK/2024). In CIRHSS, *CompLexico* subsumes two research strands: the [*Indonesian Languages, Documentation and Learning*](https://www.cirhss.org/our-research/indonesian-languages-documentation-and-learning/) and [*Digital Humanities*](https://www.cirhss.org/our-research/digital-humanities/).  

*CompLexico* is initiated and led by [Gede Primahadi Wijaya Rajeg](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2047-8621). It aims at both pedagogical and research-related goals. From the pedagogical side, the pre-cursor of *CompLexico* is Gede's undergraduate teaching of the English Lexicology and Lexicography course, and his involvment as the convener of the Corpus Linguistics course in the Linguistics Doctoral program, both in the Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University. From the research side, *CompLexico* grew from (i) Gede's interests in cognitive lexical semantics, usage-based cognitive linguistics, quantitative corpus linguistics, and (ii) his [postdoctoral work](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/gede-rajeg) at the University of Oxford to build digital [lexical resources for Enggano](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/Lexical_resources_for_Enggano), a threatened Austronesian language spoken in the [Enggano island](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9TZcjHvqeQWNcuUA7), Bengkulu, Indonesia (PI: Prof. [Mary Dalrymple](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/mary-dalrymple); co-PI: Prof. [I Wayan Arka](https://researchprofiles.anu.edu.au/en/persons/wayan-arka); funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council [AHRC; [AH/W007290/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW007290%2F1)] [cf. the Enggano webpage](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/)).

### About the logo

The main inspiration to create a circular logo comes from the [Lexibank project](https://lexibank.clld.org/)[^1]. The logo of *CompLexico* combines two [Heptapod](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Heptapod) <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)#:~:text=Because%20unlike%20speech%2C%20a%20logogram,Linguists%20call%20this%20nonlinear%20orthography." target="_blank">logograms</a> from the [*Arrival*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/) movie. The outer logogram/circle in the logo means 'Humanity' ([original image](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/blob/master/ScriptLogoJpegs/Humanity1.jpg)) in the Heptapod language. Meanwhile, the inner logogram means 'Solve on you now' ([original image](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/blob/master/ScriptLogoJpegs/SolveOnYouNow1.jpg)). Each of these logograms is provided with the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) (cf.

The original black colour of the outer logogram is modified and filled with an image of computer code shared by [Markus Spiske](https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/matrix-movie-still-iar-afB0QQw?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash). The colour of the inner logogram is also replaced with another computer code image shared by [Mitchell Luo](https://unsplash.com/@mitchel3uo?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/black-and-white-striped-textile-FWoq_ldWlNQ?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash). As a whole, the logo symbolises *CompLexico*‚Äôs focus on the application of computational and digital tools to investigate, analyse, and hopefully ‚Äùsolve‚Äù (some of the) issues in the field of humanities, particularly lexicology and lexicography. The *CompLexico* logo is conceptualised, designed, and created by Gede Primahadi W. Rajeg using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and is accessible via [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25744971).
