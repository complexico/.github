# CompLexico

### *Computer-assisted Lexicology and Lexicography (CompLexico)*

A research group under the [Indonesian Languages, Documentation and Learning](https://www.cirhss.org/our-research/indonesian-languages-documentation-and-learning/) strand within [CIRHSS](https://www.cirhss.org/) at the Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University (formalised in 2024 by the Research and Community Outreach Department of Udayana University). *CompLexico* is initiated and led by Gede Primahadi Wijaya Rajeg. It aims at both pedagogical and research-related goals. The pre-cursor of *CompLexico* is Gede Rajeg's research interest in corpus linguistics and lexicology. This is manifested, from the pedagogical side, in his teaching (and supervision [cf. here](https://github.com/complexico/anger-mad-coca/blob/main/README.md)) of corpus linguistics and modern lexicographic tools (e.g., [COCA](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/), [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/), and [WeSay](https://software.sil.org/wesay/)) for undergraduate students in the English Lexicology and Lexicography course, and for convening the Corpus Linguistics course in the Linguistics Doctoral program at Udayana University. From the research side, *CompLexico* grew, among others, from Gede's postdoctoral work (funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council [AHRC]) at the University of Oxford to develop lexical resources for Enggano, a threatened Austronesian language spoken in the [Enggano island](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9TZcjHvqeQWNcuUA7), Bengkulu, Indonesia (PI: Prof. Mary Dalrymple; co-PI: Prof. I Wayan Arka; [cf. the Enggano webpage](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/)).

### About the logo

The main inspiration to create a circular logo comes from the [Lexibank project](https://lexibank.clld.org/). The logo of *CompLexico* combines two [Heptapod](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Heptapod) logograms from the [*Arrival*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/) movie. The outer logogram/circle in the logo means 'Humanity' ([original image](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/blob/master/ScriptLogoJpegs/Humanity1.jpg)) in the Heptapod language. Meanwhile, the inner logogram means 'Solve on you now' ([original image](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/blob/master/ScriptLogoJpegs/SolveOnYouNow1.jpg)). Each of these logograms is provided with the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) (cf. [here](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/blob/master/COPYING.md)) inside [this directory](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/tree/master/ScriptLogoJpegs) under this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WolframResearch/Arrival-Movie-Live-Coding/tree/master). The original black colour of the outer logogram is modified and filled with an image of computer code shared by [Markus Spiske](https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/matrix-movie-still-iar-afB0QQw?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash). The colour of the inner logogram is also replaced with another computer code image shared by [Mitchell Luo](https://unsplash.com/@mitchel3uo?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/black-and-white-striped-textile-FWoq_ldWlNQ?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash). As a whole, the logo symbolises *CompLexico*‚Äôs focus on the application of computational and digital tools to investigate, analyse, and hopefully ‚Äùsolve‚Äù (some of the) issues in the field of humanities, particularly lexicology and lexicography. The *CompLexico* logo is conceptualised, designed, and created by Gede Primahadi W. Rajeg using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and is accessible via [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25744971).
